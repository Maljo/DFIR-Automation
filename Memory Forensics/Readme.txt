Python code to automate the collection of DFIR memory forensics using the Volatility framework:

The script sets the output directory, process name, process ID, Volatility path, profile, and plugin list. The script then creates the output directory and uses the memdump command from Volatility to dump the process memory to a file. The script then iterates over each plugin in the plugin list and runs the plugin against the memory dump file to generate a text output file in the output directory. Finally, the script prints a success message.
